## Devlog
A scene is like an entire city. It holds everything that exists in that world, from streets to parks to skyscrpaers. Inside the city, each GameObject is like an individual building or structure. Some might be simple streelights, while others might be tall office towers or small homes. Componenst are what makes each building unique. these are the parts that determine how the building functions: the lights that turn on and off, the elevators that move, the doors that open,, and the wiring that connects it all. A building without any compoenents would just be an empty shell. In one sentence, the scene orgaizes how everything fits together, the game objects form the visible structures, and the components give them prupose and behavior.
